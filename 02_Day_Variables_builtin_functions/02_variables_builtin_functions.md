## Built in functions






### The print() function

Look at the line of code below

```
print("Hello, World!")
```
The word _print_ that you can see here is a *function name*. That doesn't mean that wherever the word appears it is always a function name. The meaning of the word comes from the context in which the word has been used.
You've probably encountered the term function many times before, during math classes. You can probably also list several names of mathematical functions, like sine or log.
Python functions, however, are more flexible, and can contain more content than their mathematical siblings.

A function (in this context) is a separate part of the computer code able to:

  - _cause some effect_(e.g., send text to the terminal, create a file, draw an image, play a sound, etc.), this is something completely unheard of the world of mathematics;
  - _evaluate a value_(e.g., the square root of a value or the length of a given test) and _return it as the function's result_, this is what makes Python functions the relatives of mathematical concepts.

Moreover, many of Python functions can do the above two things together.

Where do the function come from?
